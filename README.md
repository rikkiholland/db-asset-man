# db-asset-man
Asset Management Digital Challenge

To build and run unit tests:
./gradlew build

To run using Spring Boot:
./gradlew bootRun

To run from JAR file:
java -jar build/libs/assetman-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar


Notes:
* Wasted a lot of time writing real Google classes before realising you can't geolocate from a UK postcode! (Google Maps API is new to me)

* Would have extended unit test coverage if more time available

* Would have included more logging if more time available

* Would have written integration tests if more time available. (Tested manually with Postman)
